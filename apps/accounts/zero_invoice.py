"""Render a Signalor-branded PDF invoice for $0 (fully discounted) payments.

Dodo Payments does not generate an invoice PDF when ``total_amount == 0``,
which is correct upstream behavior but leaves customers without a receipt
for promo/comp/100%-off subscriptions. This module fills the gap by
producing a PDF locally with the same line-item breakdown a normal Dodo
invoice would show.
