"""Drop the orphaned `mentioned_competitors` jsonb column on analyzer_prompttrack.

The column was added by an earlier model iteration that has since been removed
from `apps/analyzer/models.PromptTrack`, but no migration was generated to drop
it. Because it's NOT NULL with no default, any new PromptTrack insert via the
ORM fails with `null value in column 'mentioned_competitors' ... violates not-null
constraint`. The competitor-mention surface now lives in PromptCitation
(is_competitor flag) and is computed at read time by CompetitorPromptListView.
